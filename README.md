# Information Security and Quality Assurance Projects - Metric-Imperial Converter

### User stories:
1. I will help prevent the client from trying to guess(sniff) the MIME type.
2. I will prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
3. I can GET /api/convert with a single parameter containing an accepted number and unit and have it converted.
4. Hint: Split the input by looking for the index of the first character.
5. I can convert 'gal' to 'L' and vice versa. (1 gal to 3.78541 L)
6. I can convert 'lbs' to 'kg' and vice versa. (1 lbs to 0.453592 kg)
7. I can convert 'mi' to 'km' and vice versa. (1 mi to 1.60934 km)
8. If my unit of measurement is invalid, returned will be 'invalid unit'.
9. If my number is invalid, returned with will 'invalid number'.
10. If both are invalid, return will be 'invalid number and unit'.
11. I can use fractions, decimals or both in my parameter(ie. 5, 1/2, 2.5/6), but if nothing is provided it will default to 1.
12. My return will consist of the initNum, initUnit, returnNum, returnUnit, and string spelling out units in format {initNum} {initial_Units} converts to {returnNum} {return_Units} with the result rounded to 5 decimals.
13. All 16 unit tests are complete and passing.
14. All 5 functional tests are complete and passing.

# Information Security and Quality Assurance Projects - Issue Tracker

### User stories:
1. Prevent cross site scripting(XSS attack).
2. I can POST /api/issues/{projectname} with form data containing required issue_title, issue_text, created_by, and optional assigned_to and status_text.
3. The object saved (and returned) will include all of those fields (blank for optional no input) and also include created_on(date/time), updated_on(date/time), open(boolean, true for open, false for closed), and _id.
4. I can PUT /api/issues/{projectname} with a _id and any fields in the object with a value to object said object. Returned will be 'successfully updated' or 'could not update '+_id. This should always update updated_on. If no fields are sent return 'no updated field sent'.
5. I can DELETE /api/issues/{projectname} with a _id to completely delete an issue. If no _id is sent return '_id error', success: 'deleted '+_id, failed: 'could not delete '+_id.
6. I can GET /api/issues/{projectname} for an array of all issues on that specific project with all the information for each issue as was returned when posted.
7. I can filter my get request by also passing along any field and value in the query(ie. /api/issues/{project}?open=false). I can pass along as many fields/values as I want.
8. All 11 functional tests are complete and passing.
